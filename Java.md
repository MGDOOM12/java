## 1. Introduction

## High Level vs Low Level Language
- High level code is made for humans to understand 
- Low level code is for computers to understand
- Source code (low) is converted to object/machine code (binary) for computers

**Compile** is to transform source code to machine code
- Source code when compiled is machine specific. When it is compiled on a MAC it can only be used on a MAC and same for Windows.
- Java has a fix for this issue which is **byte code** which acts as a mediator and is cross platform. 
- **JVM** will conver btye code to machine code.
    - Where can a JVM be found in a JDK.

## JDK
